<h2 class="h2b">Revenge at Last</h2>
<p>Listen to Part 1:</p><audio controls="True" id="audio_part_1"><source src="chapter09_part1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/><p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p></audio><p class="para">Years passed. Now I feel that my life is nearly over.</p>
<p class="indent-para">I followed the Monster wherever he led me. I followed him through forests and across deserts. I crossed flat plains and high mountains.</p>
<p class="indent-para">At last we have reached this place of ice and snow. The cold is terrible. But the Monster feels nothing. He does not feel cold or heat. Always, he has been in front of me. I get near him, but I can never catch him.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Now the journey has ended. The Monster is ready to stand and fight. He is bigger and stronger than me. But I have my gun. I will be able to kill him before he kills me.</p>
<p class="indent-para">I can see the Monster in front of me. His terrible shape looks black against the white snow. He has stopped at last. He has turned to look at me.</p>
<p class="indent-para">‘Do not kill me yet, Victor Frankenstein,’ the Monster cried. ‘Listen to what I have to say.’</p>
<p class="indent-para">‘What can you say to me?’ I replied. ‘You have destroyed everything I loved. You are a thing of evil – a wicked creature.’</p>
<p class="indent-para">‘You made me,’ the Monster replied. ‘You are guilty. I did not wish to be evil. I wanted to be your friend. But you made me ugly. You ran away from me. Those I tried to love were afraid of me. So, I killed them.</p>
<p class="indent-para">‘I asked you to create a friend for me. But you destroyed her. I had no family to love, so I destroyed yours.</p>
<p class="indent-para">‘My wicked life made me unhappy. But I could not stop. Pain and unhappiness turned to anger in my mind. You are guilty, Frankenstein. You gave me this ugly body. You <a class="calibre1" id="page_51"></a>created me, you are a wicked man.’</p>
<p>Listen to Part 2:</p><audio controls="True" id="audio_part_2"><source src="chapter09_part2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/><p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p></audio><p class="indent-para">As I listened to the Monster’s words, my mind was filled with horror.</p>
<p class="indent-para">‘What you say is true,’ I cried. ‘I was the murderer of those I loved!’</p>
<p class="indent-para">‘Now you have said these words my life of misery and unhappiness is complete,’ said the Monster sadly. ‘You are the guilty one, not me. Now I shall go far away from here. I shall find wood. I shall set light to it. Then I shall throw myself on the flames. My death will be terrible. But at last I will be at peace.’</p>
<p class="indent-para">And with one last look at me, the Monster turned and went to his lonely and terrible death.</p>
