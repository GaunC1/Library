<p class="chaptitle1">The King is Dead!</p>
<p class="noindent">We now return to the real prince, who has just run away from John Canty. Prince Edward was walking to the Great Banquet hall. He wanted to tell everybody that he was the real prince.</p>
<p class="indent">When he arrived outside the Great Banquet hall, there were a lot of people waiting.</p>
<p class="indent"><a class="calibre1" id="page_29"></a>‘We want to see the prince!’ the people shouted.</p>
<p class="indent">Edward pushed his way through all the people.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I am the prince!’ he said angrily. ‘You can see me now! I am here!’</p>
<p class="indent">The people looked at this boy and they laughed. He was wearing rags. He was a pauper.</p>
<p class="indent">‘You’re not the prince!’ one man said to him.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Don’t be stupid!’ said a woman. ‘Look,’ she said to her friends, ‘This boy thinks he’s Prince Edward!’</p>
<p>Listen to Part 2:</p><audio controls="True" id="audio_part_2"><source src="Chapter07_part2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/><p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p></audio><p class="indent">‘I <em class="calibre3">am</em> Prince Edward! I have no friends but I am the prince!’ he shouted. He wanted to cry. The people stopped laughing at Edward. They were angry with him now.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Be quiet!’ they said to him. ‘Stop saying you’re the prince! You’re wearing rags.’</p>
<p class="indent">The people pushed him and pulled him. One person even hit him. Edward tried to run but there were too many people. He was frightened and worried.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Leave him!’ shouted a very tall man, suddenly. He was strong and wore soldier’s clothes. The clothes looked very old and his hat was broken.</p>
<p class="indent">‘He’s only a boy! Don’t hit him! Boy, I don’t know if you are a prince but I will be your friend. My name is Miles Hendon.’ Miles pushed the people away. Edward felt OK for a moment.</p>
<p class="indent">‘There’s my boy!’ It was John Canty again. He was very angry when he saw Edward. ‘There you are!’ he said. ‘Come with me! I will hit you for running away from me!’</p>
<p class="indent">Miles told John Canty, ‘You will not hit this boy again! He can live with me now.’</p>
<p class="indent">‘Yes!’ said the prince. ‘He is not my father. I hate him!’</p>
<p class="indent">John Canty did not listen. He tried to take the prince but Miles stopped him. Then Miles picked Edward up and quickly carried him away from John Canty.</p>

<p class="indent">‘You helped me. When I am king, I will make you a knight!’ said the prince.</p>
<p class="indent">Before Miles could say anything else, a boy came running through the streets.</p>
<p class="indent">‘The king is dead!’ he shouted. ‘Long live Edward, King of England!’</p>
